To complete this exercise,
your task is to call the built-in print() function. You must ensure the text "Hello World !"
is passed inside the parentheses, enclosed in quotation marks (either single ' ' or double " " ). 
The quotation marks tell Python that the text is a string (a sequence of characters).
